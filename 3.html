		<div>ABOUT US</div>
		<div>CEO
</div>
		<div>QPD Co-founder and Chief Technologist Dr. Xi Qin is an associate researcher at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). He was previously the director of a pre-research project and the chief designer of scientific satellite projects at the SECM (Shanghai Engineering Center for Microsatellites). After joining QPD, his group have designed several products with leading technique indicators. In pursuit of the long-term development of QPD, Qin is also devoted to construction of the Innovative Quantum Instruments Platform, which serves as an open platform for investigating advanced quantum technologies and lowering the difficulties of frontier research.

		<div>Arbitrary Sequence 
Generator

</div>
		<div>Arbitrary Waveform Generator （ASG-GT50）is a 8-ch pulse sequence generator with non-dead-time. The pulse signals output by ASG-GT50 has a time resolution of 50 ps, and a dynamic range from 5ns-2s. ASG-GT50 can be applied in high precision quantum control, quantum precision measurement, magnetic resonance and etc. ASG-GT50 is the latest released pulse/delay generator and is a sale promotion discount is available.

		<div>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the 
iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, 
in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through 
the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s.
